# Note to tutors

This dir contains the 'exercise' for the self-assessment.
Participants see the R-selfassess.md file, which is rendered by Jekyll locally 
(see `../../local-render.sh`) or by github (after pushing).

The source to the ansers is `answers.Rmd`. To render it, call the
`knit-it.sh` (which differs slightly from `../../knit-it.sh`) script.

When satisfied , `git commit` both the `*.Rmd` and `*.md` files and push
it to github.

It should then become visible as
https://scgenomics.github.io/self-assess/R-selfassess.html
